              They were working on a project to build an energy big data
              platform to collect electricity big data and develop deep learning
              algorithms. There were difficulties in integrating time series
              data from various electricity and energy data source equipment,
              and since the platform was built on open source, commercialization
              was slowed down due to incompatibility between open source
              packages and low technical maturity.
            </p>
            <p class="tech-title" id="anchor3">Reason for Selection</p>
            <p class="tech-contents-text">
              Machbase Time Series DB eliminated the need to build a complex
              system with a single solution and provided data collection
              interfaces for a variety of data sources. It also made it easy to
              integrate with visualization solutions.

            <p class="tech-title" id="anchor4">Solution</p>
            <p class="tech-contents-text">
              For data collection, we provided a data collector to collect
              different data sources such as Modbus TCP, REST API, and CSV file,
              and collected and stored real-time power data using Machbase time
              series DB. We also provided drivers for Grafana integration and
              Python integration to analyze and monitor the collected data.

            <p class="tech-contents-text">
              The simplicity of the platform architecture and the SQL support
              reduced the learning curve for existing developers, reducing the
              overall project duration from four months to two weeks, allowing
              the project to be completed on time.
