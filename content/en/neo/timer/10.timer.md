## Timer Schedule Spec.

There three possible 
examples)

```
0 30 * * * *           Every hour on the half hour
@every 1h30m           Every hour thirty
@daily                 Every day
```

### CRON expression

  | Field name   | Mandatory? | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters |
  | :----------  | :--------: | :-------------  | :------------------------- |
  | Seconds      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -                    |
  | Minutes      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -                    |
  | Hours        | Yes        | 0-23            | * / , -                    |
  | Day of month | Yes        | 1-31            | * / , - ?                  |
  | Month        | Yes        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * / , -                    |
  | Day of week  | Yes        | 0-6 or SUN-SAT  | * / , - ?                  |

- Asterisk `*`<br/>
  The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field;
  e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month.

- Slash `/`<br/>
  Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field
  (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter.
  The form "*/..." is equivalent to the form "first-last/...", that is, an increment over
  the largest possible range of the field. The form "N/..." is accepted as meaning "N-MAX/...",
  that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not
  wrap around.

- Comma `,`<br/>
  Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI" in the 5th
  field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

- Hyphen `-`<br/>
  Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between
  9am and 5pm inclusive.

- Question mark `?`<br/>
  Question mark may be used instead of `*` for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week
  blank.

### Predefined schedules

  |Entry                  | Description                                | Equivalent To |
  |:-----                 | :-----------                               | :------------ |
  |@yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        | 0 0 0 1 1 *   |
  |@monthly               | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | 0 0 0 1 * *   |
  |@weekly                | Run once a week, midnight between Sat/Sun  | 0 0 0 * * 0   |
  |@daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day, midnight                   | 0 0 0 * * *   |
  |@hourly                | Run once an hour, beginning of hour        | 0 0 * * * *   |

### Intervals

`@every <duration>` where "duration" is a string that is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers,
each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ms", "s", "m", "h".

```
@every 10h
@every 1h10m30s
```
