```sh
machbase-neo shell "ALTER USER SYS IDENTIFIED BY my_password"
```

> Escape from OS shell
>
> When execute SQL statement in non-interactive mode on command line like above example,
> OS shell's special characters should be escaped.
> For example, if we execute `machbase-neo shell select * from table` without quotation marks.
> '*' will be interpreted by bash (or zsh) as 'all files'.
> `\`, `!`, `$` and quotation marks should be carefully used for the same reason.
>
> Or we can execute command in neo-shell interactive mode.
> Execute `machbase-neo shell` then it will show prompt `machbase-neo >>`.
> In interactive mode with machbase-neo prompt, no more shell escaping is required.
